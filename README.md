Synchrotron MX Robot

This project was developed in the process of redevelopment of the software architecture to improve the maintainability of MX Sample Automounting Robots at the Australian Synchrotron.

The main idea was to go away from the managed Visual C++ code to the native SPEL+ code for handling the MX SAM Robot manoeuvres. The goal was also to have a good documented and a structured code. This is beneficial by 1. Reducing debugging time for diagnosis investigation and resolution 2. Making the code compatible to run on newer and future 4 axis robots 3. Making it easier to maintain, i.e. add additional features and to make changes if necessary
